These screenshots are Enes Gönültaş' valuable instructions to me about how to install root on ubuntu when I was trying to install it for the first time for Phys442. They are great so I thought it is a good idea to archive them. 

I found a good tutorial on youtube. Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLybgCU6QCGWLdDO4ZDaB0kLrO3maeYAe
