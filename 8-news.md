After being able to run the code we got from İrem, Erhan Gülmez gave us another plottter. You can find it in /raddam-diary/plotter_vs_pdfs/ along with Burak Bilki's first version, and the version we get from İrem. (I only added there those which have already compiled. Thus, two that Erhan Gülmez gave us perivously are not included there.)  
We have the results there, nice and tidy. They gave different number of pdfs. I will add my observations about them here:

1) 0_plotter does not work for 321585: it gave results for 321025.
2) Q1.pdf's are the same for 1_plotter and 2_plotter.
3) Q2overQ1.pdf's are the same for both, as well.
