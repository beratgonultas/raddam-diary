After being able to run the code we got from İrem, Erhan Gülmez gave us another plottter. You can find it in /raddam-diary/plotter_vs_pdfs/Berat/ along with Burak Bilki's first version, and the version we get from İrem. (I only added there those which have already compiled. Thus, two that Erhan Gülmez gave us perivously are not included there.)  
We have the results there, nice and tidy. They gave different number of pdfs. I will add my observations about them here:

0) 0_plotter does not work for 321585: it gave results for 321025.
1) Q1.pdf's and Q2.pdf's are the same for 1_plotter and 2_plotter.
2) Q2overQ1.pdf's are the same for both, as well. (From now on I talk about 1_plotter and 2_plotter, not 0_plotter)
3) Q2overQ1first.pdf's and Q2overQ1third.pdf's are the same for both.  
4) QTotal.pdf's are the same in shape but different in Mean and Std Dev.
5) TDC1-1vsTDC1-2.pdf's looks like the same.
6) TDC2-1vsTDC2-2.pdf's looks like the same.

So, except QTotal.pdf's, the common pdf's for 1_plotter and 2_plotter seems to be the same.
