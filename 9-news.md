Erhan Gülmez told us the latest run for HFRadDam. It is 336149 and taken on 15 July 2020. It can be found on Elog: https://cmsonline.cern.ch/webcenter/portal/cmsonline/pages_common/elog?__adfpwp_action_portlet=623564097&__adfpwp_backurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcmsonline.cern.ch%3A443%2Fwebcenter%2Fportal%2Fcmsonline%2Fpages_common%2Felog%3FMedia-Type%3Dscreen&_piref623564097.strutsAction=%2FviewSubcatMessages.do%3FsubId%3D8%26mode%3Dexpanded%26page%3D110

He expects us to analyze this run number. Here is a summary of his instructions:
1) Firstly, we might need to use a newer version of CMSSW, prefably the latest version.
2) We need to get Q2+Q3/QT graph. This is the graph from which İrem has deducted which TS to use. (See her thesis) However, I think, I and Erdem have never got that graph. So, we need to figure out how to get it.
3) After editing timing if needed, we should check cuts.
