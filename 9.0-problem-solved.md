We had a problem about getting the "same" plots. Details can be found in 9-news.md 

Erdem figured out that actually these plots are not the same. So, there is no problem. Since they are really similar, we thought they are same, so we thought there is something wrong.   
They are similar, but not the same. Actually, it is not surprising that they are so much similar: in fact they ought to be thatt much similar because the division of the laser in each channel is constant though being different from channel to channel.   
Therefore, now, everything is working fine. We just have some important missing plots that are present in İrem's thesis. (Such as Figure 7.14/15 and Figure 7.21) We wrote İrem about them. 

After a long period of waiting, İrem told us that she can't no longer help us because she is very busy and everything we need is in her thesis and at Erhan Gülmez. We don't think that this is true. But well, okay.

Since we didn't get the code already written, we must do it by ourselves. Figure 7.14/15 must be produced by a different code than plotter.C. So, let's consider 7.21 first. We have some code related to it in plotter.C that İrem gave us in Drive. Here is the link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U3LKjGMUPs680bFzI0TZJR3UQ_uTflBW?usp=sharing

Search "Q1_Q2overQtotal" in the plotter.C found at the link above. You will see some code around line 650 which are commented out. I undid it. Then, in lxplus, I deleted previously generated stuff, that is Histos, Plots, NTuples, and previous versions of the program and the code, that is plotter and plotter.C. Then I uploaded this new file to lxplus. After this, I typed cmsenv command and I compiled the code with "make plotter". Then I ran the code for 321585 hoping to get the new plots for (Q1+Q2)/Qtot  
But there were no new plot. The result was same as before.  

After examining the code, now I realised that 29 plots we got has something to do with the code around line 960. Notice that there is a "n" which runs from 0 to 28. So, maybe it won't be sufficient but it is necessary to do add Figure 7.21 there.
