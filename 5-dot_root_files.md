In NTuples, Data and Histos folders, we have files with .root extensions. (Note: To work with files, it is highly recommended to download a copy of HFRaddamAnalyzer to your local area in advance for simplicity.)

The way to open examine them is as follows:

1. Open root in a terminal. 
2. Type ``new TBrowser``
