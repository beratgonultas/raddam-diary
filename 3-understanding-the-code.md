### Comparing the Plots

Previously, I was able to run the code. Next step is to examine its inputs-outputs, what it involves and how it is connected to physics of the project.

There is the original path of the files:

```/afs/cern.ch/work/b/bilki/public/CMSSW_8_0_16/src/HCALCommissioning2017/HFRaddamAnalyzer/```

And also there is my personal copy in my area:

```~/public/CMSSW_8_0_16/src/HCALCommissioning2017/HFRaddamAnalyzer/```

So I have two copy of both PulseShapes.pdf and TDCShapes.pdf. And we expect a difference since I ran the analyzeTS.sh one additional time for 321025 compared to the original one.

To detect where those pdfs are, I used ```find``` command.
