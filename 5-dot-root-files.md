In **NTuples**, **Data** and **Histos** folders, we have files with .root extensions. (Note: To work with files, it is highly recommended to download a copy of HFRaddamAnalyzer to your local area in advance for simplicity.)

The way to examine them is as follows:

1. Open root in a terminal. 
2. Type ``new TBrowser``
3. A window will open up. There you can double click on any .root files to see its content.
